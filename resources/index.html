        <b>Introduction</b>
        <p>
            Computer Science is an incredibly broad field, and it is tough for beginners who are interested in the subject to get into the subject because of the sheer variety and depth of the branches of CS. Here is a small collection of resources for studying various CS subjects.
        </p>
        <u>Programming Fundamentals</u>
        <p>Everything starts with the basics. Even if you are interested in a select few or even a single branch of CS, learning the fundamentals should be the first step before specialization.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Really solid book teaches you and explains to you in a clear way that other resources such as Youtube tutorials cannot replicate</li>
        </ul>
       <p>Command Line Basics</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Every computer scientist should be familiar with their command lines in their native operating system (OS)</li>
            <li>
                <ul>Command lines are a way to have text-based communication with one‚Äôs computer, allowing you to do things like running programs or executing a variety of commands</ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Here are guides for Windows, MacOS, ans Linux (because MacOS and Linux are Unix based, they both use terminal. MacOS uses z-shell instead of bash like linux but you can select run bash instead if you choose too. In addition, the two are almost identical at times so learning one is essentially the other (small syntax differences, a lot of times everything works in the other):

            <li>One of the best websites to learn cybersecurity, it also covers topics such as the linux filesystem and various other things like how to use bash (terminal) and other cybersecurity tools. It includes ‚Äútracks‚Äù for pentesting, basic linux and computer skills/knowledge necessary for more advanced tracks. TryHackMe is really good for introductory, hands-on learning and covers a variety of subjects at a decent depth that relate to cybersecurity.</li>
